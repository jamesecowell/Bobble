# Bobble

Bobble is a native iOS application that is currently in early stages of development. 

Its purpose is to view and track results from Rally events across the globe, with detailed historical results from various competitions and championships, as well as profiles for drivers, co-drivers and teams. 

Users will be able to save their favourite events and drivers, and view their most recent results from the homescreen.
